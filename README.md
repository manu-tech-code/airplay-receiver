A fully featured free and open-source implementation of AirPlay for Android that turns your device into an AirPlay-compatible display and speaker, based on [UxPlay](https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay). It is the first open-source AirPlay 2 receiver for Android and Android TV, and works with iOS/iPadOS, macOS devices as well as other sender implementations.

## Compatibility

- Android 7.0+, including Android TV
- AirPlay devices on the same subnet, including iOS/iPadOS, macOS devices, or other sender implementations

## Features

- Screen mirroring with H.264 and H.265 (HEVC) video decoding
- Audio streaming with AAC-ELD, AAC-LC and ALAC audio decoding
- Video playback with support for HLS, downloads, and remote controls
- Music playback with track information, cover art, and remote controls
- Support for Android TV with directional pad navigation and seeking controls
- Support for Picture-in-Picture, automatic resolution and mode switching
- Optional PIN authentication
- Video resolution, overscan, and frame rate control
- Audio latency control and support for software decoder fallback
- Debug overlay with real-time statistics (FPS, bitrate, codec, resolution, frame count, audio volume, etc.)
- Android native media session integration with notification controls

> [!WARNING]
> DRM content (e.g. from the Apple TV application) is not supported.

## Implementation

This application uses the C-based [UxPlay](https://github.com/FDH2/UxPlay) library to implement the AirPlay/RAOP protocol, with a JNI bridge to the Android application layer. Audio can be decoded via MediaCodec or a software ALAC decoder, while mirroring video is decoded via MediaCodec and rendered to a SurfaceView. HLS sessions are served through a local playlist proxy.

    AndroidApp["Android (Receiver)<br/>MediaCodec + AudioTrack<br/>ExoPlayer (HLS)"]

    AppleDevice -- "RAOP / HLS" --> UxPlay
    UxPlay --> AndroidApp
```

CMake is used for native C/C++ components under [`app/src/main/cpp`](app/src/main/cpp). Submodules must be initialized before building. 

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
./gradlew assembleDebug
```
